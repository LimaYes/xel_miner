<h1><b>I no longer have time / desire to work on the Elastic project after all the fud and negative critisim of the project</b></h1>

<b>I was just helping out with the project trying to push it forward after the intial issues it faced when the original dev left...maybe someone else can take what I've done with the miner / elasticpl and improve upon it.</b>

Miner		v0.9.6
ElasticPL 	v0.9.1

This is a prototype of a miner for solving XEL work packages.  <b>The miner is not optimized in any way</b> as its purpose is to demonstrate all the functionality of ElasticPL and the workflow between the Miner & Elastic Node regardless of hardware or OS.

It is intended that other developers will improve upon the miner performance & functionality by creating versions for specific hardware / OS including all applicable optimizations.

<b>*** The GPU miner is highly experimental.  If you choose to use it, monitor your cards closely to ensure they don't overheat. ***</b>
________________________________________________________________________________________________

The miner build has been tested using GCC on Ubuntu 16.04 as well as MinGW32 (using GCC) on Windows 7/10.

Below are the steps I used to get the miner running on an Ubuntu server & Raspberry Pi.
<ul>
<li>sudo apt-get update</li>
<li>sudo apt-get install cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libudev-dev screen libtool pkg-config libjansson-dev libssl-dev</li>
<li>git clone https://github.com/sprocket-fpga/xel_miner.git</li>
<li>cd xel_miner</li>
<li>cd build</li>
<li>cmake .. (note, if you are using OpenCL, then use "cmake .. -USE_OPENCL"</li>
<li>make install</li>
</ul>

<b>*** Don't forget to use "make install" and not just "make" ***</b>

To run the Miner using CPU:

    sudo ./xel_miner -t <num_threads> -P <secret_phrase> -D

To run the Miner using GPU:

    sudo ./xel_miner -t <num_threads> -P <secret_phrase> -D --opencl

Use "sudo ./xel_miner -h" to see a full list of options.
